# Face_Detection_and_Emomotion_Recognition

The motivation behind choosing the topic Face detection and emotion recognition, is it allows the technologies automate the process of analyzing and understanding facial expressions, eliminating the need for manual evaluation. By automating these tasks, businesses, organizations, and systems can operate more efficiently and save time and resources. And In this project, my approach is to develop a reliable and accurate system for face detection and emotion recognition, Where I have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the model training . After training the model, it  is integrated with the OpenCV. In OpenCV the face can be detected and the emotions can be displayed. Additionally, recognized emotions can be heard.
